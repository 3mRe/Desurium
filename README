Build Desura
===================

Download and install:
 * TortoiseSvn http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads.html. Make sure to install command line tools
 * TortoiseGit http://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/downloads/list
 * Windows Sdk 7.1 http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=8279

 * CMake 2.8 http://www.cmake.org/

Run ./build_cmake.sh

In order to make use of multiple CPU cores while compiling, run
./build_cmake.sh -j8
which will invoke "make -j8" so the build is speeded up extremely
only 7 mins on my machine (intel core i7 2635QM)
"8" will be the number of compile-thread to run at a time

Required dependencies (can be installed by package manager or install-deps.sh):
boost
c-ares
gtk2
OpenSSL
tinyxml
v8

Optional dependencies (will be built by cmake if not existing):
bzip2
sqlite

cef is needed from official distribution see #5
Just copy required libs to install/lib

Finally run Desura using ./run_desura.sh
